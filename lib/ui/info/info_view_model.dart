It uses NASAâ€™s open API for InSight, their weather station at the Elysium Planitia, as well as the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) on the Curiosity Rover using web scraping.\n\nIt is sadly not real-time because it takes a few days for the spacecraft to beam down the data. So weâ€™re about 4-5 days behind. Sads ðŸ˜”.';

      'I definitely want to add more to this. It ainâ€™t done yet. I want to build a machine learning model to be able to predict the weather for the upcoming days (and days that havenâ€™t been beamed down yet), but that time crunch of 6 hours didnâ€™t really give me the time for that. Maybe also show past weather? I also want to do some quality-of-life stuff with some UI/UX changes. More animations and data would be great!';
